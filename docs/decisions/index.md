# ðŸ“– Architectural Decision Registry

[This article](https://adr.github.io/#lightweight-architectural-decision-records-should-be-adopted) explains briefly what is an ADR. Let's try to build a simple one, with basic markdown (mainly taking notes and keeping the functionality of the app up to date)!

It would mainly focus on giving as much focus as possible on those points:
- **Status**: what is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?
- **Context**: what is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
- **Decision**: what is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
- **Consequences**: what becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

We may focus on components, but this can be extrapolated to any decision making global or local.

The [Known issues section](/known_issues.html) is an even broader reference, more related to the project itself.
