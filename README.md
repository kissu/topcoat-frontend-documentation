# Documentation for the frontend

This documentation is focused on the Vue part.

To read this one, you can do
```
yarn
yarn dev
```

Or you can even use [`ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni) if you'd like.

This is using Vite, so you'll get some super fast launch and refresh.

For any configuration, the main entry point is `/docs/.vuepress/config.js` and the documentation for this one is located here on [this Github](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/)
